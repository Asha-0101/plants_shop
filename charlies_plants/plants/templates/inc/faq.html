                    Proper plant care depends on the type of plant you have. Here are some general tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Most plants prefer consistent watering. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering can cause wilting. Check the soil moisture before watering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Light:</strong> Ensure your plant gets the right amount of light. Some plants thrive in bright, indirect light, while others prefer low-light conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Tropical plants often require higher humidity. You can mist them regularly or use a humidifier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to promote healthy growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Regularly trim dead or yellowing leaves to encourage new growth.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For specific care instructions, refer to the care guide provided with your plant or contact our support team.
